**Scene 1: The Tip-Off**

**INT. ANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

Ana sits at her desk, surrounded by files and scattered papers.  She's exhausted but determined.  Her phone rings.

**ANA:** (Answering) Ana speaking.

**VOICE (O.S.)** (Whispering)  It's about the city contracts… Castillo.  Meet me tomorrow, noon, by the old fountain in Elm Park.  Don't trust anyone.

The line goes dead. Ana stares at the phone, a flicker of fear and excitement in her eyes.


**Scene 2: The Meeting**

**EXT. ELM PARK - DAY**

Ana nervously waits by the fountain. A figure approaches, shrouded in shadow. It's an elderly man, RAUL, his face etched with worry.

**RAUL:** (Whispering) They're stealing millions. Castillo's skimming off every major city project.  I have proof – documents, emails.  But I can't risk being seen.

Raul hands Ana a memory stick.

**ANA:** (Concerned)  And what about you? Are you safe?

**RAUL:** I'm not worried about myself.  I just want the truth to be told.  Be careful, Ana.  They're watching.

Raul disappears as quickly as he came.  Ana stares at the memory stick, a weight of responsibility settling upon her.


**Scene 3: The Investigation**

**INT. NEWSROOM - DAY**

Ana shows Marco the memory stick.

**ANA:**  I think we have a huge story here, Marco. Mayor Castillo's corrupt.

**MARCO:** (Sighs) Ana, we've looked into Castillo before. Nothing ever sticks.  This could be dangerous.

**ANA:** But this is different. This is real proof.

**MARCO:**  (Skeptical)  And you're sure about this source?  Anonymous tips are risky.

**ANA:** I trust my instincts.  This feels different.


**Scene 4: The Confrontation**

**INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY**

Ana, armed with evidence from the memory stick, interviews Mayor Castillo. He exudes charm and confidence.

**ANA:** Mr. Mayor, we have evidence suggesting irregularities in city contracts.  Millions of dollars unaccounted for.

**CASTILLO:** (Smiling)  Miss… what's your name?  A young journalist trying to take down the mayor?  That's quite ambitious.  Are you sure your sources are reliable?

**ANA:**  Very sure, Mr. Mayor.  I have documentation to prove it.

Castillo's smile falters.  He tries to dismiss her, but Ana presses on, showing him concrete evidence of his illicit dealings.


**Scene 5: Threats and Choices**

**EXT. ANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

Sergio approaches Ana, his menacing presence silencing her.

**SERGIO:**  The Mayor wants a word.  He's disappointed in your… enthusiasm.

**ANA:**  I'm doing my job.  I'm exposing corruption.

**SERGIO:**  You're playing a dangerous game, Ana.  You can walk away from this.  No one needs to know.

Sergio leaves her with a chilling warning.  Ana is left alone, grappling with the fear and moral dilemma before her.


**Scene 6: Publication and Aftermath**

**INT. NEWSROOM - DAY**

Ana's article is published, causing a city-wide uproar.  Mayor Castillo is arrested. The story makes international headlines.

**INT. ANA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT**

Ana sits at her desk, exhausted but satisfied.  She looks at a photograph of Raul, a quiet tribute to the man who risked everything for the truth.  The fight is far from over, but she has taken the first step.  The price of silence is too high.  The price of truth? Incalculable, but worth it.  The phone rings. It’s Marco.

**MARCO:** (On the phone)  Ana, congratulations. You did it.  Even I didn't believe it would work.

**ANA:** (Smiling faintly) It wasn’t just me.
